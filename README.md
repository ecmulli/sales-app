# Predicting Store Sales

TODO:
- [ ] Integrate grid search cv to choose best model and write those predictions out
- [ ] Improve readability  of code
- [ ] delete superfluous files 
This project utilizes data from the Kaggle competition posted by Rossman Stores to generate predictions for ~1100 stores.

I practiced model building in both R and Python though the predictions from `main.py` are used in `optim-app` on the sales predictions page.
